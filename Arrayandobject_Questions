Array Manipulation:

Reversing an array.
Removing duplicates from an array.
Finding the intersection or union of two arrays.
Sorting arrays based on certain criteria.
Implementing common array methods (e.g., map, filter, reduce) from scratch.
Rotating an array to the left or right by a given number of positions.
Checking if two arrays are equal.
Object Manipulation:

Adding, updating, or deleting properties from an object.
Deep cloning an object.
Checking if an object has a specific property.
Merging two objects while handling conflicts.
Iterating over object properties.
Converting object keys or values into an array.
Implementing common object methods (e.g., Object.keys, Object.values) from scratch.
Algorithmic Challenges:

Searching and sorting algorithms involving arrays of objects.
Solving problems like finding the maximum subarray sum, longest increasing subsequence, etc.
Implementing data structures like stacks, queues, or hash maps using arrays or objects.
Solving problems related to dynamic programming, graph traversal, or recursion where arrays or objects are involved.
Performance Optimization:

Optimizing code for time complexity and space complexity.
Understanding the performance implications of different array and object operations (e.g., accessing elements, adding/removing elements).
Using appropriate data structures (arrays vs. objects) based on the requirements of the problem.
Functional Programming:

Using array methods like map, filter, and reduce to manipulate arrays in a functional style.
Composing functions to achieve complex transformations on arrays or objects.
Understanding concepts like immutability and pure functions and applying them in array and object manipulation.
