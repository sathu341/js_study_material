Currying in JavaScript is a functional programming technique that transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This process allows for partial application of arguments, creating new, specialized functions by fixing some parameters. 
How Currying Works:
Original Function: You start with a function designed to take all its arguments at once.
JavaScript

    function multiply(a, b, c) {
      return a * b * c;
    }
Curried Transformation: The function is transformed into a series of nested functions. Each inner function takes one argument and returns another function, until all arguments are provided. 
JavaScript

    function curriedMultiply(a) {
      return function(b) {
        return function(c) {
          return a * b * c;
        };
      };
    }
Partial Application: You can then call the curried function step-by-step, providing arguments one at a time. Each call returns a new function that "remembers" the previously provided arguments due to closures.
JavaScript

    const multiplyByTwo = curriedMultiply(2); // Returns a function that takes b
    const multiplyByTwoAndThree = multiplyByTwo(3); // Returns a function that takes c
    const result = multiplyByTwoAndThree(4); // Returns 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
Alternatively, you can call it all at once:
JavaScript

    const resultDirect = curriedMultiply(2)(3)(4); // Returns 24
Benefits of Currying:
Partial Application:
Enables the creation of new functions by pre-filling some arguments, leading to more specialized and reusable functions.
Code Reusability and Composability:
Curried functions are inherently more modular and can be easily combined or composed with other functions.
Flexibility:
Allows for more flexible function invocation patterns and the creation of highly tailored functions for specific use cases.
